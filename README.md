Hi, my name is Eric Patterson. Welcome!!

Here you will find a bunch of different repositories of my projects, I usually try to make a new project once a week if not more

I am currently attending SAIT for their New Media Production & Design course, although I have self taught myself most of everything I know.
I have completed both Udemy's Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp and The Odin Projects Fullstack Javascript course

I am currently learning more about the MERN / MEAN stack.

Right now I am working on a Python Web Scrapping tool to help a local business find which liquors on their distributors websites are on sale.

You can reach me at ericpattersonwork@gmail.com or via my personal portfolio at https://ericpatterson.me/ where I have some of my projects on display.
